# BLANKA

BLANKA is a command line tool used to remove noise and blank background signals from mass spectrometry data. It does so by comparing spectral similarity of MS/MS sample and blank data to determine whether or not a feature is a media component.

This repo contains the current development version of BLANKA actively being worked on. For the publication version, please see [here](https://github.com/gtluu/blanka).
